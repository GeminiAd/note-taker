## Description

Welcome to Note Taker '98: we come bundled with Windows '98!

I'm just kidding. I'm poking fun of the fact that the front end is basic, not mobile-responsive, and not created by me. *Every* web app I make looks good on *any* device. I can do better than having my web application break on mobile resolution, and I hold myself to a higher standard than that.

With that being said, this is just a simple note taker application, where you can enter a note title and note text, and save it. You can also delete notes. For more specific instructions on how to use the application, see [Usage](#usage).

## Key Features

- Take notes.
- Notes are saved to disk, so they persist between sessions.
- Clean, non-mobile-responsive design.

## Usage

Navigate to: <https://note-taker-98.herokuapp.com/>.

You're taken to a splash page. Click the "Get Started" button to go to the notes page. The notes page initially displays all stored notes. You can click on a saved note on the left, and that note will be displayed inside of the main content window. Click the "+" icon to create a new note. Once you are done entering values for the note title and note text, a save icon appears next to the add icon. Click the save icon and the note will be saved and added to the list of notes on the left-hand side. Click the delete icon within each note on the left-hand side and that note will be removed from the list of saved notes.
